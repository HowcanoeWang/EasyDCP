## Using Agisoft auto control

open pipeline-all.py
-change 'path_folders' to the path containing the folders of images
-change 'blur_threshold' to desired value. Pipeline will disable all images with Agisoft image quality below the blur_threshold.
-set ignore_gps, align_ground, and use_scalebars depending on need

Ensure folder structure matches intended format
- only folders in root folder (path_folders), no files in root
- 'skip' folder contains scalebars.csv if needed
