# Paper - 3Dphenotyping [Deprecated - Working in Google Docs https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E-a4MgMSM8KgAtBTQ1at1qHCPCWirKf19LddKAyruMg/edit?usp=sharing ]

## Abstract
(copied from IPPS Abstract)
Currently, it is possible to use softwares/tools to produce 3D point cloud and related output to be used for extracting phenotypic data from a set of images. 
However, this process is time-consuming and requires user input. Here we propose a pipeline that can automate this process through scripting commands. 
3D reconstruction software can be automatically controlled by API, and parameters can be passed that will ensure an accurate result. 
The pipeline can process multiple image sets when executed, so large populations of plants can be efficiently analyzed. 
The input of the pipeline is an image set or group of image sets, and the output is 3D point cloud and related output such as DEM/orthophoto, as well as phenotypic data such as canopy cover, morphological traits etc. 
The system is affordable because the hardware is a standard RGB camera that can be handheld over plant pots, or mounted to UAV. Any PC can run the software and pipeline. 
The softwares are Agisoft Metashape and python/Matlab, which also can be acquired easily. 
The pipeline is affordable high-throughput because many pots can be quickly photographed with an RGB camera, and the pipeline can handle multiple image sets. 
In this study, 200 pots were photographed in under 3 hours (6 plants per image set, 34 image sets) and automatically generated pointcloud, DEM/orthophoto for each image set by the pipeline. 
Each DEM/orthophoto is then used to create CSV containing phenotypic data. 
This is a scalable solution that can enable researchers to get detailed measurement data with reduced labor and capital costs.

## Introduction

### Background
"High-throughput phenotyping technologies have become an increasingly important topic of crop science in recent years" (Wang Y, 2018)
"Accessing  a  plantâ€™s  3D  geometry  has  become  of  significant  importance  for phenotyping  during  the  last  few  years. " (Christian Rose J, 2015)
"In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in the construction of geometrically accurate models of plants." (Pound M, 2014)
"In recent years, high-throughput plant phenotyping earned momentum, focusing mainly on non-invasive image-based techniques" (Agapito L, 2015)
"In plant phenotyping, there is a demand for high-throughput, non-destructive systems that can accurately analyse various plant traits by measuring features such as plant volume, leaf area, and stem length." (Golbach F, 2016)
"Reconstructing plant surfaces from point cloud data is important for several applications in plant science, including estimating the leaf area and volume of the plant (Moorthyet  al.2008 )" (Kempthorne D, 2014)
- Similar statement to above?

### Purpose
The purpose of this work is to develop a pipeline that can extract phenotypic traits from a large (arbitrary) number of container plants with minimal time and money cost.
Additionally, multiple image sets (e.g. time series data) must be supported, so that large datasets can be easily processed. 
The expected input is a set of images suitable for 3D reconstruction, and the output is a data file containing phenotypic traits (plant height, long and short axis, projected leaf area, leaf area index) per plant. 

### difference of our work
The advantage of our pipeline is that it provides an affordable method to extract phenotypic traits from container plants using a single RGB camera and open-source hardware with minimal labor time cost.
Affordable
- Software: Agisoft metashape pro (Edu license $549USD)
- Hardware: PC, GPU (optional but recommended), Scalebars/Markers (can print or buy $495 USD for set of 10 from CHI), RGB Camera
Open-source code developed in Github, will make public after publication.
- Commercial solutions such as Phenospex Planteye use closed-source code.
Low time cost: one-time initial setup, then can be automatically run for all similar cases (e.g. time series data).
